#summary Maven HOWTO
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

The aim of this project it to be built with maven2. The good side to this is that we should cut down on the ant xml clutter but the downside is what some would say that maven has "a steep learning curve". I would argue that this is utter nonsense but hey, different strokes for different folks! Disclamer: maven2 has xml clutter of its own but it's easier.

= Details =

Maven is a tool that can be used for building and *managing* any Java-based project.

First you need to install maven 2, to do so follow these [http://maven.apache.org/download.html#installation instructions] : 
(Steps: Download, unzip, set the path to the binary folder, I usually add a M2_HOME variable and use that as the base for the path).

Checkout the project from subversion

{{{ svn checkout http://jspart.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ jspart }}}

For the moment we're using postgresql as database so you'll need that. You'll also need to create a user jspart with the password jspart, and make him owner of the database jspart.
Then you can generate the tables by doing:

{{{ mvn package hibernate3:hbm2ddl }}}

You'll need to do package as the task needs to execute with the project compiled. If it already is compiled and the .class files are present you don't need to use package. I'll see if I can bind this to the process-classes life cycle.

Compile and install into local repository

{{{ mvn clean install }}}

I'll soon add more maven tips here.
